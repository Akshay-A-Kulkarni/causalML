## Course Description

How can we model and create decision making agents that actually understand their environment? How will changes to an ad-placement system impact revenue?  How can we test changes to a content feed without serving junk content to the control group?  How can we make sure our decision-making algorithms aren't amplifying the racism, sexism, and other societal-'isms' that bias the training data?

Causal inference answers these questions by enabling predictions about a system's behavior after an intervention, something mathematically impossible for deep learning and other advanced pattern recognition methods.  Data scientists with causal inference skills are increasingly sought after by the top tech companies.

This course introduces key ideas in causal inference in how to apply them to areas of artificial intelligence where they have the most impact, such as reinforcement learning, agent modeling, and improving the performance of machine learning systems using past human-interaction data.  The focus is on how to put these ideas into practice with real world machine learning systems. Topics include structural causal models, counterfactual reasoning, observational vs. experimental data, full-information vs. partial information data, batch learning from bandit feedback, handling selection bias in data, policy learning vs. reward prediction.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for the class are: knowledge of machine learning algorithms and its theory, basic probability, basic statistics, and general mathematical maturity.

## Scribing

Each lecture will have a 2-3 assigned scribes who will be jointly responsible for producing notes in Markdown (we will make a template available). Each student will be assigned to two groups over the course of the semester. Notes will be due 1 week after the class takes place, and will be graded as part of the course work.

## Readings

While many great causal inference textbooks exist, none focus on the key problems in machine learning and AI that will be addressed in this class.  So instead we will focus heavily on assigned readings. Students are expected to read the assigned readings in advance of each lecture (stay tuned to this page for a reading list).

## Homework

The homework in this class will consist of 5 problem sets, which will combine mathematical derivations with programming exercises in Python. Submissions must be made via blackboard by 11.59pm on the due date.

## Project

The goal of the project is to gain experience in implementing, testing, and presenting one of the methods covered in the lectures. Students will collaborate in groups of 2-4. We will provide a list of suggested problems to choose from.

## Grading

The final grade for this course will be weighted as follows:

    Homework: 30%
    Scribing: 20%
    Midterm Exam: 15%
    Final Exam: 15%
    Course Project: 20%

## Self-evaluation

Students will be asked to indicate the amount of time spent on each homework, as well as the project. The will also be able to indicate what they think went well, and what they think did not go well. There will also be an opportunity to provide feedback on the class after the midterm exam.
