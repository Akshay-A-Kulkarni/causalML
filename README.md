## Course Description

How can we model and create decision making agents that develop an understanding of their environment? How can we make sure bandit algorithms are led astray by some unexpected influence?  How can we measure the direct impact of a change to systems that serve ads, assign content to a feed, or direct a fleet of drivers impact bids/engagement/rides?  How can we make sure our predictive algorithms are not amplifying biases in the training data in a way that leads to disastrous decision-making?

Causal inference answers these questions by enabling predictions about a system's behavior after an intervention, something not possible even with the most advanced pattern recognition methods alone.  For this reason, the skillful application of causal inference is essential for the success of in-production machine learning at scale.

This course introduces key ideas in causal inference and how to apply them to areas of machine learning where they have the most impact, such as A/B testing, bandit algorithms, reinforcement learning, agent modeling, and improving the performance of machine learning systems using past human-interaction data.  The focus is on how to put these ideas into practice with real-world machine learning systems. 

This course targets data scientists and ML engineers familiar with probabilistic [generative modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) in machine learning.  Learners familiar with how to use a tensor-based framework to build a GMM or a VAE will find the material grafts directly onto this modeling intuition.  This course focus on causal probabilistic modeling and structural causal models as they fit nicely into the generative model framework and corresponding toolsets.  The Neymanâ€“Rubin causal model is discussed but given less attention.

Learners who want to improve a multiarmed bandit or sequential decision process applied in a complex environment will also gain much from this course. 

Learners who seek to see causal inference language from the statistics, econometrics, epidemiology, and cognitive science literature united under a set of case studies relating to the engineering of large scale machine learning systems, have also come to the right place.

## Prerequisites

(DS5220 and DS5230) or (CS6140 and CS6220) or approval of the instructor

## Scribing

Each lecture will have a 2-3 assigned scribes who will be jointly responsible for producing notes in Markdown (we will make a template available). Each student will be assigned to two groups over the course of the semester. Notes will be due 1 week after the class takes place, and will be graded as part of the course work.

## Readings

While many great causal inference textbooks exist, none focus on the key problems in machine learning and AI that will be addressed in this class.  So instead we will focus heavily on assigned readings. Students are expected to read the assigned readings in advance of each lecture (stay tuned to this page for a reading list).

## Homework

The homework in this class will consist of 5 problem sets, which will combine mathematical derivations with programming exercises in Python. Submissions must be made via blackboard by 11.59pm on the due date.

## Project

The goal of the project is to gain experience in implementing, testing, and presenting one of the methods covered in the lectures. Students will collaborate in groups of 2-4. We will provide a list of suggested problems to choose from.

## Grading and Academic Guidelines

The final grade for this course will be weighted as follows:

    Homework: 40%
    Scribing: 20%
    Course Project: 40%

Refresh your knowledge of the university's [policy](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/) about academic integrity and plagiarism (this includes plagarizing code). There is **zero-tolerance** for cheating!

## Self-evaluation

Students will be asked to indicate the amount of time spent on each homework, as well as the project. The will also be able to indicate what they think went well, and what they think did not go well. There will also be an opportunity to provide feedback on the class after the midterm exam.
